# Contributing to Ctor

We really appreciate and value contributions. Contributing is a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies, their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.


## Report feedback
All bugs, feature requests, questions, feedback, etc., is welcome. Feel free to post them [here](https://github.com/wslyvh/ctor/issues/) and use one of the templates provided. Before you do, please make sure no similar issues have been reported. You might find your answer there.


## Create Pull Requests (PRs)

As a contributor, you are expected to fork this repository and then submit pull requests. Pull requests will be reviewed and merged into the main repo. See ["Fork a repo"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) how this works.


### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation. Use `tslint`.
- Make sure to run the tests! Write or adapt them as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
